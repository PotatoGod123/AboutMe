                    background other than some coding classes I took in highschool. My education at the moment is
                    my High School Diploma and I recently just started my journey into Software Engineering as a student int Code fellows! So far i'm having a great time and quickly 
                  learning and developing new skills and techniques to strife foward into the coding world.</p>
